One year ago today I was at my best.
I was away from everything and everyone I was used to.
Simply out of y comfort zone, yet happy.
I thought I hade been doing well all this time but I guess I was wrong.
Or at least, things don't always go as planned.
The past couple of days have been quite tough, but you know...it is what it is
Things are slightly getting better so I have to take this chance
Take this chance to keep going no matter what.
Because in the end, certain things need to be done no matter what.
I have an important interview next week.
wish me good luck :)
